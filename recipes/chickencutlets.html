            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Process croutons in a food processor until finely 
                crumbled, around 8 ounces</li>
            <li>Prepare dredging station. Stir together croutons, 
                breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper, oregano, mustard, 
                garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a shallow bowl.

                (200 degrees C). Lightly coat the air fryer basket with 
                cooking spray</li>
